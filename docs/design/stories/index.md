# Architectural and Technical User Stories

<!--
- Develop detailed use cases for each major functionality.
- Outline user scenarios to understand the application flow.
- Develop user stories that capture the functional and technical requirements of the system from an architectural perspective.
- Each story should clearly state the 'who', 'what', and 'why' to articulate the needs of different system components or stakeholders (even hypothetical ones).

Theses stories try to capture the requirements pertinent to the architecture, development, deployment and operation of a performant, robust, scalable, and secure microservices application in a cloud environment.

Two distinct sets of user stories guide our projectâ€™s development and operational approach.

The first set comprises functional user stories, which concentrate on the specific actions, behaviors, and capabilities the system must exhibit to meet the core operational goals.

In contrast, the second set consists of non-functional user stories. These are essential in outlining the operational qualities and constraints of our system.

Together, these two sets of user stories create a comprehensive blueprint that addresses both the 'what' and the 'how' aspects of the system, ensuring a balanced focus on functionality and operational excellence.

They should provide a solid foundation for the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of the system, ensuring that all critical aspects are addressed.
