# Architecture principles


## Microservices

Each functionality of the application has been broken down into autonomous, independent and specialized services.
Each microservice is responsible for a specific part of the application, making it easy to maintain, deploy and scale each component individually.

Microservices communicate with each other via REST APIs, enabling flexible and decentralized communication.
This architecture allows the application to benefit from greater scalability, resilience and ease of deployment of new features.
