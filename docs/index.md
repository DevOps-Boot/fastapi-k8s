## About The Project

This project is part of the assessment for the French [DevOps Administrator Diploma (RNCP36061)](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/36061).

It aims to demonstrate candidates' skills in architecting, building, deploying, and monitoring microservices applications on cloud infrastructure, adhering to DevOps culture, and using automation tools and techniques extensively.

The application stack includes Traefik, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and various DevOps tools for infrastructure automation, continuous integration and deployment, as well as monitoring and observability.
