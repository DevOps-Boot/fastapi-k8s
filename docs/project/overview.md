# Project Overview


## Project Context


### Background Information

This project is an integral part of the assessment for the {{DevU}} {{DevOps_Cert}}, and the {{RNCP36061}}.

It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the candidate's expertise and proficiency in key areas of {{DevOps}} practices.

The project aims to showcase a holistic approach to software development, deployment, and operations, emphasizing modern methodologies and tools like Agile Software Development Life Cycle, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, Observability, and Infrastructure as Code.


### Purpose of the Project

The primary purpose of this project is to evaluate the candidate's ability to architect, build, deploy, and monitor a microservices-based application in a cloud environment, specifically within a Kubernetes cluster.

It aims to assess the candidate's skill set in applying DevOps principles and practices to real-world scenarios, highlighting the importance of automation, continuous integration and deployment, and monitoring in the software development lifecycle and IT operations.

The project is designed to showcase a wide range of skills and knowledge essential for a DevOps engineer.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Architecting a scalable and resilient microservices application.
- Building the application with a focus on automation and best practices in software development.
- Deploying the application to a container cluster, demonstrating skills in orchestration.
- Implementing CI/CD tools and processes to enable automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- Monitoring and logging the infrastructure and the application to ensure performance and reliability.


### Technical Environment

The project revolves around a microservices architecture application, utilizing a combination of Traefik, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. This setup is given as an example of a realistic and commonly used stack in modern cloud-native applications.

The deployment target is a Kubernetes cluster, which is the de facto standard for orchestrating containerized applications. This choice reflects the current industry trend towards Kubernetes and its ecosystem for managing complex applications.


## Objectives


### Automate Cloud Infrastructure Deployment

- Develop and execute scripts for automating server creation, ensuring that server provisioning aligns with the project's architecture requirements.

- Implement an automated infrastructure deployment process using configuration management tools like Ansible or Terraform, targeting a cloud environment (private, public, or hybrid).

- Integrate robust security measures at every stage of infrastructure deployment to safeguard against vulnerabilities.

- Establish a test and pre-production environment for validating updates and configurations before they are deployed to production.


### Continuously Deploy an Application

- Prepare and manage a test environment for deploying the application, ensuring a reliable testing ground for development iterations.

- Efficiently manage data storage and database configurations, focusing on scalability and performance.

- Create and manage containers for the application, leveraging tools like Docker and orchestrators like Kubernetes for deployment.

- Execute continuous deployment of the application on a chosen platform, ensuring seamless integration and minimal downtime during updates.


### Monitor Deployed Services

- Define key performance indicators for the services and set up monitoring tools to track these metrics, enabling proactive management of the infrastructure and application.

- Operate a comprehensive monitoring and observability solution to identify and address anomalies, ensuring high availability and reliability of services.


### Transversal Skills in Employment

- Implement a problem-solving approach to tackle challenges encountered during the project, demonstrating analytical and critical thinking.

- Demonstrate continuous learning by adapting to new tools and technologies, engaging with professional communities, and staying updated with the latest DevOps trends and practices.


### Professional Communication and Teamwork

- Engage with professional communities, possibly in English, to share insights, seek advice, and contribute to collective knowledge.
