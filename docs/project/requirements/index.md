# Project requirements


A DevOps project implementing a containerized microservices application architecture in the Cloud requires a detailed study and careful elicitation of the functional and non-functional requirements.

We start by gathering needs by collecting user stories, from which we extract technical requirements. Next, we focus our attention on the specific requirements for the key components of the system. Finally, we specifying and design the target architecture.
