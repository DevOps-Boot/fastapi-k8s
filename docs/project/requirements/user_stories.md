# Architectural and Technical User Stories

<!--
- Develop detailed use cases for each major functionality.
- Outline user scenarios to understand the application flow.
- Develop user stories that capture the functional and technical requirements of the system from an architectural perspective.
- Each story should clearly state the 'who', 'what', and 'why' to articulate the needs of different system components or stakeholders (even hypothetical ones).

## Functional user stories

Theses stories try to capture the functional requirements pertinent to the architecture and operation of a robust, scalable, and secure microservices application in a cloud environment.

They should provide a solid foundation for the development, deployment, and maintenance of the system, ensuring that all critical aspects are addressed.

### Testing & QA

- As a CI/CD engineer, I need to set up GitHub Actions workflows for automating the build, test, and deployment processes of the application.

- As a QA engineer, I want to integrate automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and reliability.


### Technical Content Creators & UX/DX

- As a documentation writer, I need to create comprehensive user guides and API documentation for the system to facilitate easy usage and maintenance.


### Compliance & Security Specialists

- As a security specialist, I want to implement robust security measures in the infrastructure setup to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.

- As a security analyst, I need to enforce role-based access control in Kubernetes to provide secure and restricted access to the cluster resources.

- As a compliance officer, I need to ensure that the entire application stack, including all tools and processes, adheres to relevant industry standards and regulations.


## Non functional user stories

These user stories focus on the specifics of the technology stack, how each component serves specific technical needs and contributes to the overall functionality and efficiency of the system.


### Application user

- As an application user, I expect quick and seamless deployment of updates without downtime using rolling updates or blue-green deployments in Kubernetes.


### Architects and DevOps

- As a system architect, I want to design a containerized application architecture using Kubernetes to ensure scalability and resilience.

- As a DevOps engineer, I need to implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automates testing, building, and deployment of microservices.

- As a cloud engineer, I need to use Terraform to script the provisioning of AWS resources like EKS clusters, ensuring infrastructure consistency.

- As a DevOps team lead, I want to establish a performance benchmarking routine for the application to ensure it meets the desired performance criteria.

- As an infrastructure manager, I need to integrate EBS for persistent storage in Kubernetes, ensuring data persistence across pod restarts.


### Ops

- As a network administrator, I need to set up internal and external DNS routing in Kubernetes to efficiently manage service discovery and accessibility.

- As a Kubernetes operator, I want to set up pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory usage metrics to handle load dynamically.

- As a system administrator, I want to set up Prometheus for detailed monitoring of Kubernetes cluster metrics and application performance indicators.

- As a logging manager, I need to configure log rotation and archiving strategies in the ELK stack to manage log data effectively.

- As a performance analyst, I want to monitor the cost of cloud resources using AWS cost management tools and optimize where necessary.


### Devs & DBAs
