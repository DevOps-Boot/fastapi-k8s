# Architectural and Technical User Stories

<!--
- Develop detailed use cases for each major functionality.
- Outline user scenarios to understand the application flow.
- Develop user stories that capture the functional and technical requirements of the system from an architectural perspective.
- Each story should clearly state the 'who', 'what', and 'why' to articulate the needs of different system components or stakeholders (even hypothetical ones).
