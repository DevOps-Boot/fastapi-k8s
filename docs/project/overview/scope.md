## Project scope and perimeter


### In-Scope


#### Infrastructure Automation and Deployment

- Automating the creation and configuration of virtual servers.
- Utilizing tools like Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure deployment in a cloud environment (private, public, or hybrid).
- Implementing security measures at each stage of infrastructure development and deployment.


#### Continuous Application Deployment

- Preparing and managing a test environment for the application.
- Managing data storage and database configurations.
- Containerization of the application, using Docker and orchestrating with Kubernetes.
- Deploying and updating the application continuously on a cloud platform.


#### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Setting up and operating monitoring tools for the infrastructure and application.
- Defining and tracking service performance indicators.
- Identifying and resolving any anomalies or issues in the deployed services.


#### Professional Skills and Team Collaboration

- Demonstrating problem-solving capabilities and continuous learning throughout the project.
- Effective communication with team members, technical managers, and external parties like hosting providers.
- Participation and contribution to professional communities related to DevOps.


### Out-of-Scope

- **Non-Cloud Deployments**: deployment on physical servers or non-cloud environments is not covered.

- **Advanced Machine Learning or AI Integration**: the project will not delve into complex machine learning or AI-driven functionalities.

- **Legacy System Integration**: integration with outdated or legacy systems is not part of this project.

- **Comprehensive User Interface Development**: while basic UI elements might be developed for application interaction, creating an advanced or comprehensive user interface is not included.

- **Non-Functional Requirements Beyond Scope**: aspects such as internationalization, extensive accessibility features, and legacy data migration are not included.


### Boundaries and Limitations

- **Resource Limitations**: the project is bound by predefined resource allocations in terms of cloud infrastructure and budgetary constraints.

- **Time Constraints**: the project has a fixed timeline aligned with the diploma program schedule.

- **Technical Boundaries**: the scope is limited to the tools and technologies specified (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, FastAPI, PostgreSQL).


#### Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Cloud Provider Accessibility**: the project assumes availability and access to the chosen cloud provider's services and resources.

- **Tool Availability**: it is assumed that all necessary tools and platforms (like Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform) are accessible and usable within the project's framework.

- **Stakeholder Support**: continued support and collaboration from team members, technical managers, and other stakeholders are assumed throughout the project's duration.
