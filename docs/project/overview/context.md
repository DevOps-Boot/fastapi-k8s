# Project Context


## Background Information

This project is an integral part of the assessment for the {{DevU}} {{DevOps_Cert}}, and the {{RNCP36061}}.

It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the candidate's expertise and proficiency in key areas of {{DevOps}} practices.

The project aims to showcase a holistic approach to software development, deployment, and operations, emphasizing modern methodologies and tools like Agile Software Development Life Cycle, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, Observability, and Infrastructure as Code.


## Purpose of the Project

The primary purpose of this project is to evaluate the candidate's ability to architect, build, deploy, and monitor a microservices-based application in a cloud environment, specifically within a Kubernetes cluster.

It aims to assess the candidate's skill set in applying DevOps principles and practices to real-world scenarios, highlighting the importance of automation, continuous integration and deployment, and monitoring in the software development lifecycle and IT operations.

The project is designed to showcase a wide range of skills and knowledge essential for a DevOps engineer.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Architecting a scalable and resilient microservices application.
- Building the application with a focus on automation and best practices in software development.
- Deploying the application to a container cluster, demonstrating skills in orchestration.
- Implementing CI/CD tools and processes to enable automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- Monitoring and logging the infrastructure and the application to ensure performance and reliability.


## Technical Environment

The project revolves around a microservices architecture application, utilizing a combination of Traefik, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. This setup is given as an example of a realistic and commonly used stack in modern cloud-native applications.

The deployment target is a Kubernetes cluster, which is the de facto standard for orchestrating containerized applications. This choice reflects the current industry trend towards Kubernetes and its ecosystem for managing complex applications.
