# Project brief

An example of a generic Python RESTful API application is proposed by DataScientest in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/DataScientest/fastapi-docker-traefik).
The project may also be suitable for those who want to create an application or modify it.

The candidate is asked to automatically deploy the application as a microservices architecture, on a completely new environment, in a secure way, and with API endpoinys proxied through {{Traekfik}}.

The infrastructure should be containerized and orchestrated by {{Kubernetes}}, deployed in the Cloud on Amazon EKS, or on a local environment.

Project realization should demonstrate:

* most of the technical elements learned during the DevOps curriculum;
* understanding of project objectives, business needs, and application functional requirements;
* design and creation of an orchestrated containerized microservices architecture;
* data management capabilities by defining and implement pertinent data and backup requirements;
* continuous integration and deployment pipelines building skills;
* aptitude to define relevant metrics and setup efficient monitoring system
* infrastructure provisioning and application deployment automation using Infrastructure as Code.

Project deliverables include:

* A git repository containing functional code and accurate documentation for the whole system provisioning and deployment.
* A project dissertation
* A presentation slide desk for the project defense
* A professional portfolio demonstrating DevOps related experiences

The full [DevOps project directives](../../appendices/directives/devops_project.md) is available in the appendices of the documentation.
