# Project objectives


## Automate Cloud infrastructure deployment

- Develop and execute scripts for automating server creation, ensuring that server provisioning aligns with the project's architecture requirements.

- Implement an automated infrastructure deployment process using configuration management tools like Ansible or Terraform, targeting a cloud environment (private, public, or hybrid).

- Integrate robust security measures at every stage of infrastructure deployment to safeguard against vulnerabilities.

- Establish a test and pre-production environment for validating updates and configurations before they are deployed to production.


## Continuously deploy an application

- Prepare and manage a test environment for deploying the application, ensuring a reliable testing ground for development iterations.

- Efficiently manage data storage and database configurations, focusing on scalability and performance.

- Create and manage containers for the application, leveraging tools like Docker and orchestrators like Kubernetes for deployment.

- Execute continuous deployment of the application on a chosen platform, ensuring seamless integration and minimal downtime during updates.


## Monitor deployed services

- Define key performance indicators for the services and set up monitoring tools to track these metrics, enabling proactive management of the infrastructure and application.

- Operate a comprehensive monitoring and observability solution to identify and address anomalies, ensuring high availability and reliability of services.


## Transversal skills in employment

- Implement a problem-solving approach to tackle challenges encountered during the project, demonstrating analytical and critical thinking.

- Demonstrate continuous learning by adapting to new tools and technologies, engaging with professional communities, and staying updated with the latest DevOps trends and practices.


## Professional communication and teamwork

- Engage with professional communities, possibly in English, to share insights, seek advice, and contribute to collective knowledge.
