## Professional Designation Review Background (NCPR)

Enterprise infrastructure is increasingly being deployed in the cloud.

32% of companies in 2018 compared to 97% in 2021 deployed part of their infrastructure in public cloud.
According to Flexera’s annual study «state of the cloud report» in 2021, 80% of companies manage their hybrid cloud infrastructure, integrating public and private cloud.

This evolution requires systems teams, who must automate deployment tasks, to acquire new skills.
At the same time, the developer teams have implemented the Agile method, which allows them to regularly produce new versions of their applications.

The implementation of applications previously required a long procedure followed by the systems teams, called Ops (as operations in English).

It was necessary that the production time be shortened as was that of the
development of new versions.

The DevOps approach that aims to facilitate collaboration between «Dev» (developers) and «Ops» pursues this objective.
80% of companies adopted the DevOps approach in 2021, compared to 41% in 2017.
